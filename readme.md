Driveto DEMO parser a "searcher"
=================

This is the MVP of my Driveto parser and searcher
There are a few things I've come across, that souhld be improved, but that was predictable, I guess :-)
For example:
    Change engine input in search form to Select2,
    Add all information to database structure,
    Test file accessibility (Chmod) on UNIX system,
    etc...
